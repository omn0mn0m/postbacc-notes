* Introduction and Cell Structure and Function
** Intro to Microbiology
- Microbiology :: Study of organisms that are individually too small (microscopic) to be seen with the unaided eye
- Microorganisms are diverse
  - Includes all bacteria and archaea
  - Various eukaryotes, virus, viroids, prions
- Microbiologists study both living microorganisms and non-living organisms (viruses and prions)

*** History
- 1665 - Robert Hooke (1635 - 1703) reported living things are composed of cells
- 1676 - Antony van Leeuwenhoek described live microorganisms that he observed in teeth scrapings, rain water, pepper-water
- Linnaeus designed classification system w/ 2 kingdoms (later succeeded by 5 kingdom system):
  1. Plantae
  2. Animalia

*** 3 Domain System
- Bacteria
- Archaea
- Eukarya

*** 5 Kingdom System
- Plantae
- Animalia
- Fungi
- Protista
- Monera

** Organisms of Microbiology
*** Bacteria
- Prokaryotes due to lack of nuclei
- Unicellular, contains peptidoglycan cell walls (in most cases), divides by binary fission (most cases)
- Metabolically diverse:
  - Autotrophs or heterotrophs
  - Phototrophs or chemotrophs
- Some are pathogenic, while most are beneficial or harmless

*** Archaea (and prokaryotes)
- Cell walls lacking peptidoglycan
- Divide by binary fission (most cases)
- Associated with living in extreme environments; oversimplification
- Include methanogens
- Not yet known to cause infectious diseases

*** Eukaryotes
- Although there are 4 kingdoms, protists have been found to have several clades equally distance from each other than they are from fungi, animalia, and plantae

**** Protozoa (protist)
- Unicellular "animal-like" protists
- No cell wall
- Are absorptive or ingestive heterotrophs
- Maybe motile via pseudopods, cilia, or flagella
- Some are pathogenic, but most are harmless

**** Algae (protist)
- Unicellular or multicellular "plant-like" protists that contain cell walls made of cellulose, photoautotrophs
- Generally not infectious, but some dinoflagellates produce neurotoxins
- Many unicellular algae are components of plankton - mostly microscopic organisms that drift or swim in communities

**** Fungi
- Have chitin-containing cell walls (most cases)
- Develop from spores or hyphal fragments
- Nonmotile
- Absorptive heterotrophic eukaryotes using organic chemicals as energy sources
- Include multicellular molds and mushrooms - masses of mycelia that are composed of filaments (hyphae)
  - Also unicellular yeasts
- Important decomposers and can spoil food
- Usually harmless or even beneficial, but some pathogens exist

**** Helminths (animal)
- Multicellular animal parasites
- Macroscopic, but go through microscopic stages in the life cycle
- Have reduced digestive, nervous, and locomotive systems
- Complex reproductive systems

***** Examples
- Phylum Platyhelminthes - tapeworms (cestodes) and flukes (trematodes)
- Phylum Nematoda - roundworms

**** Viruses
- Obligate intracellular parasites that replicate only when they are in living host cells
- Contain DNA or RNA (as their genomes)
- Have protein coats (except viroids, which only have single stranded RNA)
- Some are enclosed by an envelope and have spikes
- Most infect only specific types of host cells
  - Host range determined by specific host cell factors and attachment sites
- Submicroscopic

**** Prions
- Infectious submicroscopic protein particles
- No nucleic acid component
- Reproduces uniquely: infectious protein physically interacts with normal protein, converting it to infectious form
- Everyone has non-infectious form in their cells
  - Infectious structure acquired by genetics, randomness, or outside source

** Human Interactions with Microorganisms
*** Extent of Microbial Life
- Number of all microbes on Earth estimated between 9.2E29 and 31.7E29 cells
- Over 10,000 bacterial species
- Over 43,000 fungal species
- Over 8,000 protozoan species
- Over 28,000 platyhelminth and nematode species

*** Microorganisms and Human Life
- Only small percentage of microorganism are pathogenic for humans, but many are beneficial
- Various aspects of human life depends on microbial activities:
  - Food production and digestion
  - Decomposition of orgnaic wastes
  - Bio-industrial production of chemicals and drugs
  - Biological research (as a domesticated lab tool)

*** Pathogens
- Pathogen :: causative agents of infectious disease
  - About 1400 human pathogen species currently known, mostly bacteria, and new microbial infectious agents continue to be identified or merge

| Group              | # of Species | % of Makeup of All Pathogens |
|--------------------+--------------+------------------------------|
| Viruses and prions |          208 |                         14.8 |
| Bacteria           |          538 |                         38.2 |
| Fungi              |          317 |                         22.5 |
| Protozoa           |           57 |                          4.1 |
| Helminths          |          287 |                         20.4 |

- Microbial infectious disease was leading cause of death in 1900
- Value of hygiene and sanitation, use of antimicrobials, and knowledge of disease progression has changed this trend

** Prokaryotic Morphology and Size
*** Morphology
- Bacterial morphology is heritable (genetic)
  - Product of natural selection
  - Morphology represents high fitness for a species given their ecosystem
- Morphology is useful for known species identification, but not useful to reconstruct phylogeny

*** Bacterial Arrangement
- Different species grow in predictable arrangements
- Useful in known species identification but not phylogenetic reconstruction

*** Size
- Typically range from 0.5 - 4 um wide and under 15 um long

**** Advantages
- Higher efficiency for a single genome
- Greater surface area : volume ratio improves nutrient exchange utilization
- A greater number of smaller cells improves rate of evolution and hence viability of species dynamic environments
- Cells have size floor: cells cannot be smaller than 0.15um in diameter

** Cell Membrane and Transport
- Cytoplasmic membrane is the absolute boundary of life
- Must distinguish and regulate movement of molecules across the boundary

*** Cell Membrane Structure
- Cytoplasmic membrane largely comprised of phospholipids
- Typical phospholipid structure: each hydroxyl of glycerol participates in a condensation reaction
- End result is gylcerol linked to 2 fatty acids and 1 charged phosphate - containing moiety
- Cytoplasmic membrane fluidity may be modified by the presence of hopanoids (some bacteria) or cholesterol

**** Membrane Proteins
- High amount of protein in the cytoplasmic membrane
- Integral membrane protein :: Spans the full thickness of the membrane
- Peripheral membrane protein :: Attached to the one side of the membrane
- Transport protein :: Allows movement of substances across the membrane through facilitated diffusion
  Others drive the movement of substances across the membrane across the concentration gradient with ATP as an energy source

*** Cell Membrane Functions
- Permeability barrier :: Prevents leakage and functions as a gateway for transprot of nutrient into and wastes out of the cell
- Protein anchor :: Site of many proteins that participates in transport, bioenergetics, and chemotaxis
- Energy conservation :: Site of generation and dissipation of the proton motive force

*** Cell Membrane Properties
- Amphipathic nature results in self assembly into energetically stable bilayer when in aqueous solution
- Fatty acids (~14-20 carbons long) are hydrophobic
- Glycerol and phosphate moiety are hydrophilic
- Any phospholipid bilayer has hydrophobic interior (fatty acids) with hydrophilic outer and inner surface
- Structure and arrangement in a bilayer/monolayer is responsible for the selective permeability of the membrane in all cells
- Membrane is not rigid, but rather fluid with frequent lateral movement of components

*** Cell Membrane Unique Features
**** Unique Features of Archaeal Cytoplasmic membrane lipids
- Glycerol linked to repeats of isoprene as opposed to fatty acids
- Glycerol linked to hydrophobic chains via ether (not ester) linkage
- Some archaeal cytoplasmic membranes are bilayers (glycerol diethers)
  - Others are monolayers (diglycerol tetraethers)
  - Others are mixers
- Archaeal membrane lipid chains may also contain sugars or carbon rings

** Prokaryotic Cell Walls
*** Cell Wall Functions
- Cell wall prevents cell lysis due to osmotic pressure
- Contributes to overall organismal morphology
- Gives the organism mechanical strength

*** Bacteria
- Key component of cell wall is peptidoglycan - crosslinked strands of glycan tetrapeptide repeats
- Long chains of peptidoglycan is formed via glycosidic linakges between adjacent glycan tetrapeptides
- Individual peptidoglycan chains are cross-linked via peptide bonds
- Glycan tetrapeptide is made of NAG bound to NAM, with 4 amino acid chains connected to the NAM
- Cell wall differs between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria
  - Can be distinguished using gram stain
  - Gram-positive have a thicker layer of peptidoglycan and teichoic acid in the cell wall
  - Gram-negative have a much thinner layer of peptidoglycan and an outer membrane (second lipid bilayer outside peptidoglycan layer) that is high in lipopolysaccharide
    - Periplasm :: Space between cytoplasmic and outer membranes is functionally important area
- LPS plays important structural role for bacteria
  - LPS molecule (Lipid A) acts as an endotoxin

*** Archaeal Cell Wall
- Always lack an outer membrane and are comprised of pseudomurein or a protein cage (S-layer)

** Additional Cell Surface Structures and Cell Inclusions
*** Capsule
- Polysaccharide or proteinaceous layer secreted outside the cell wall
- Used for surface/host cell attachment
- Aid in biofilm formation
- Help the cell avoid immune detection
- Prevent dessication

*** Fimbriae and Pili
- Filamentous proteins extending from cell surface that have diverse functions

**** Functions
- Adherence
- Facilitating exchange of genetic material between bateria (conjunction)
- Twitching motility

***** Twitching Motility
- Bacteria add/subtract protein subunits to lengthen/shorten pili
- Terminal end has attachment protein
- Bacteria lengthen pili until it attaches to its substrate
- On attachment, shortens pilus, pulling bacteria to attachment point
- Repeats  to move along surface

*** Inclusions
- Intracellular aggregates in prokaryotes

**** Functions
- Store organics for carbon/energy reservoirs (poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid or glycogen)
- Store mineral reserves (phosphorus or sulfur)
- Store magnetic minerals in magnetosomes
  - Allows bacteria to detect and move in response to Earth's magnetic field

*** Endospore
- Certain bacterial species differentiate into endospores when they face poor harsh conditions
- Have essential cellular material packaged inside a core wall
- Outside the core wall are specialised protein-based layers (spore coat and exosporium)
- Core has high amounts of dipicolinic acid complexes which bind free water and protect DNA from heat
  - Also has small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP)
  - SASP binds and alters DNA structure, conferring UV and dry-heat protection

**** Formation Stages
- Stage 1 :: Asymmetric cell division; commitment to sporulation
- Stage 2 :: Septum forms, separating prespore and mother cell
- Stage 3 :: Prespore engulfed by mother cell
- Stage 4 :: Cortext forms from prespore, surrounded by cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane
- Stage 5 :: Coat forms from Ca2+ uptake, SASPs, and dipicolinic acid
- Stage 6, 7 :: Maturation and cell lysis
- Germination :: Free endospore becomes cell and process cycles

** Prokaryotic Locomotion
*** Flagella
- Long helical protein structures anchored to the cell membrane and cell wall
- May be anchored at one or both cell poles (polar flagellation)
- May be anchored at several different locations along the cell surface (peritrichous flagellation)
- Flagellar motor :: Composed of rotor (basal body) and stator (Mot protein)
  - Proton motive force provides energy needed by the Mot protein to spin rotor proteins (in archaea, powered by ATP)

*** Gliding Motility
- Slow, smooth movement along a surface
- Mechanisms of gliding motility among prokaryotes is diverse and include twitching motion and ratcheting

*** Taxis
- Movement of bacteria towards attractant
- Chemoreceptors or photoreceptors are membrane proteins that sample the environment for stimuli strength
- Strenght info is transduced to motility proteins

** Basic Eukaryotic Cell Structure and Function
*** Nucleus
- Membrane-bound region that contains genetic material
- Nuclear envelope has pores for transport in and out of the nucleus
- DNA is packed through association with histones
- Nucleolus is region within nucleus that serves as the primary site for rRNA synthesis

*** Endosymbiosis
- Theory that energy producing organelles started as separate organisms and were symbiotically connected to a cell

**** Mitochondria
- Plays essential role in cellular respiration (transferring the energy from sugars and lipids into ATP)
- Citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix
- Oxidative phosphorylation occurs at the inner membrane

**** Chloroplasts
- Carry out photosynthesis (transfer from electromagnetic radiation to simple organic compounds)
- Chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane absorbs light and drives the light reactions
- Rubisco in the stoma catalyses Calvin cycle

**** Hydrogenosome
- Found strictly in fermentative anaerobic eukaryotic microbes
- After fermentation, pyruvate is converted into acetate in the hydrogenosome and in the process additional ATP is generated

*** Endomembrane Systems
- Includes endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, transport vesicles, lysosome

**** Secretion
- Ribosome synthesising proteins do so at the rough ER
- Localise the protein inside the rough ER
- Protein then folded and modified, then moved to Golgi by a vesicle
- In the Golgi, the protein is further modified and sorted into a vesicle to be taken to the final destiation

**** Cytoskeleton
- Also aids in locomotion
- Eukaryotic motility structures (flagella and cilia) are internal rods of microtubules associated with the motor protein dynein
- Size of eukaryotic cells demands greater internal structure support - cytoskeletons
  - Microtubules
  - Microfilaments
  - Intermediate filaments

* Microbial Growth
** Laboratory Cultivation of Microorganisms
*** Lab Growth Media Requirements
- Growth conditions vary greatly among species

**** Raw materials
- Usuable sources of C, H, O, N, S, P, and Se to build new required materials
- Builds DNA and cytoplasmic membrane

**** Energy source
- Glucose
- Drives necessary reactions

**** Essential dietary requirements
- Cannot be synthesised by the the cell
- H2O, Na+, Ca++, trace elements, growth factors

*** Growing Media
- Microorganisms can be grown in liquid media or solid media
- Autoclaving :: Heating with high pressure steam at 121 C for > 15 minutes to sterilise media

**** Defined Media
- Defined composition

**** Complex Media
- Include highly nutritious substances with an undefined composition

**** Liquid Media
- Broth

**** Solid Media
- Agar (polysaccharide) added to the growth media
- Media heated to produce molten agar media
- As it cools, it solidifies

**** Specialised Classes of Media
- Enriched Media :: Infused with highly nutritious substances (e.g. blood) to support growth of nutitionally demanding organisms
- Selective Media :: Contains compound that allows growth of certain organisms/genotypes, but not others (e.g. LB plates with ampicillin)
- Differential Media :: Contains indicator that changes colour when the microorganisms have completed a particular metabolic reaction

*** Inoculation
- Requires proper aseptic technique
- Inoculum :: sample of microorganism introduced to medium for cultivation
- Culture :: Microorganisms that grow from an inoculum
  - Also refers to the act of cultivating microorganisms or the microorganisms that are cultivated

**** Steps
1. Flaming the loop sterilises it
2. Tube cap is removed
3. Flaming the tube tip sterilises the surface
4. Only sterilised portions of loop enters tube
5. Tube is inflamed
6. Tube is recapped; loop is resterilised

*** Obtaining Pure Cultures
- All cells must be same species and genetically "identical"

**** Methods
- Streak out the source of microorganisms on an agar plate so they can select an isolated single colony
  1. Loop is sterilised and a loopful of inoculum is removed from tube
  2. Initial streak is worked in well in one corner of the agar plate
     - Subsequent streaks are at angles to the first streak
  3. Appearance of well-streaked plate after incubation

** Environmental Factors Influencing Microbial Growth
*** Carbon and Energy Source
- Autotrophs use CO2 as a raw material for building organics, while heterotrophs must obtain a pre-existing organic molecule as their source of usable carbon
- Microbes may also be classified based on their source of energy
  - Chemical (Chemotrophy)
    - Organic chemicals (Chemoorganotrophs)
    - Inorganic chemicals (Chemolithotrophs)
  - Light (Phototrophy)

*** Temperature
- Below optimal growth temp, growth is hampered and molecular motion and general rates of reactions are slowed
- Above laboratory growth temp vary greatly among microorganisms and reflect species' natural habitat
- Optimal laboratory growth temperatures vary greatly among microorganisms and reflect species' natural habitat

**** Psychrophilic Organisms
- Optimum growth < 15C
- Have unique protein structure
  - Greater number of unsaturated phospholipids in their cytoplasmic membrane
  - Make cold-shock chaperones
  - Store cryoprotectants

**** Hypethermophiles
- Evolved heat-stable proteins through greater utilisation of charged amino acids on protein surface
- Greater hydrophobicity in the protein's core

**** Mesophiles
- Most medically or agriculturally relevant bacteria
- Foods prone to bacterial colonisation/growth are heated prior to consumption and stored at 4C or -20C
- Psychotolerant :: Refrigeration slows but does not completely prevent growth (expiration date)

*** pH
- Various microorganisms grow at different environmental pH optimums
- Cytoplasmic pH is almost always close to neutral (e.g. DNA is acid-labile)
- Lab growth media usually is buffered to maintain a constant extracellular pH

*** Water Availability
- Water availability depends on amount of free water molecules present (inversely related to amount of solute present)
- Movement of free water follows the laws of diffusion
  - Free water moves from higher concentration area (hypotonic) to lower concentration area (hypertonic)
- Halophiles :: Organisms that grow optimally in salt concentrations greater than or equal to sea water
  - Cope with low free water outside the cell by accumulating and regulating the amounts of compatible solutes in their cytoplasm
  - Compatible solutes vary among species but include sugars, alcohols, and KCl
- Osmophiles :: Organisms that survive in sugar, which otherwise dehydrates many microbes
- Xerophiles :: Organisms that grow in extremely dry (lack of water) environments

*** Oxygen and Microbial Growth
- Microorganisms grouped according to whether they use oxygen for metabolism (aerobe) or not (anaerobe)
- For anaerobes, highly reactive oxygen radicals are unable to be broken down by enzymes

**** Further Classification
***** Aerobes
- Obligate :: O2 required, aerobic respiration
- Facultative :: O2 not required but growth better with O2, aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, fermentation
- Microaerophilic :: O2 required but at levels lower than atmospheric, aerobic respiration

***** Anaerobes
- Aerotolerant :: O2 not required and growth no better when O2 present, fermentation
- Obligate :: O2 harmful or lethal, fermentation or anaerobic respiration

**** Requirements
- O2 requirements must be met for optimal laboratory growth
- If O2 demand is high, liquid culture tubes are shaken during growth to aerate the media
- To exclude O2, reducing agents may be added to reduce O2 or special O2-free growth chambers may be employed

** Prokaryotic Reproduction
- Binary Fission :: mechanism of growth for prokaryotic populations
- If cells continuously double at a consistent rate, the result would be exponential growth

- Fresh media :: First cells often must significantly alter gene expression to suit new conditions
- Spent media :: Depleted space, depleted nutrients, waste build up

- True exponential growth is theoretical and often not observed, particularly when growing microorganisms in closed systems (batch culture)
- Growth in lab can approach exponential if grown in an open system (continuous culture)
  - Fresh media is added while spent media is removed during growth
  - Commonly performed in a chemostat

*** Binary Fission
- Highly regulated process of a single-cell microbial cell doubling in size then portionning into 2 distinct organisms both "identical" to the original cell

**** Steps
1. If growth conditions allow it, cell will increase in # of enzymes, ribosomes, cytoplasmic membrane, and copy DNA
2. Each copied chromosomes(s) must attach to the cytoplasmic membrane to one side of the cell or the other
3. New cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall grows inward at the plane of division , forming a septum
4. Septum formation continues until two separate cells exist

**** Plane of Division
- Protein FtsZ is crucial for division of the parent cell
- In bacteria, thousands of FtsZ proteins assemble into a ring at the plane of division
- FtsZ ring is connected to the interior cytoplasmic membrane
- FtsZ does not play an enzymatic role in fission, but rather act as a physical scaffold for enzymes and motor proteins that divide the membrane and synthesise new cell wall

**** MinCDE System
- FtsZ localises to the center due to MinCDE activity
- MinC and MinD assemble into spiral structures (red) along the inside of plasma membrane
- MinCD complexes prevent FtsZ from binding
- MinE (green) moves back and forth along the inner cytoplasmic membrane, disassembling any MinCD complexes
- End result is at any one instant, an assembled MinCD is much more like to be found at the poles than the midline
- FtsZ rings are most likely to form where MinCD is least likely to be found (middle of cell)

** Controlling Microboial Growth Outside the Body
*** Terminology
- Sterilisation :: Destruction or removal of all forms of microbial life, including endospores
  - Usually done by steam under pressure or a sterilising gas such as ethylene oxide
- Commercial Sterilisation :: Sufficient heat treatment to kill endospores of Clostridium botulinum in canned food
  - More-resistant endospores of thermophilic bacteria may survive, but they will not germinate and grow under normal storage conditions
- Disinfection :: Destruction of vegetative pathogens
  - May make use of physical or chemical methods
- Antisepsis :: Destruction of vegative pathogens on living tissue
  - Treatment is almost always by chemical antimicrobials
- Degerming :: Removal of microbes from a limited area, such as the skin around an injection site
  - Mostly a mechanical removal by an alcohol-soaked swab
- Sanitisation :: Treatment intended to lower microbial counts on eating and drinking utensils to safe public health levels
  - May be done with high-temperature washing or by dipping into a chemical disinfectant

*** Physical Methods of Reducing Microorganisms
- Used outside of body
- Autoclave :: Denatures proteins (moist heat) or create reactive oxygen species (dry heat) methods
- Pasteurisation :: Method of heating foods to kill pathogens and control spoilage organisms without altering quality of food
  - Thermoduric (heat-tolerant) and thermophillic (heat-loving) organisms survive treatments
  - Flash Method (High-temperature short-time or HTST) :: 72C for 15 sec
  - Ultra-High Temperature Method :: 135C for 1-4 sec
- Refrigeration and Freezing :: Decreases metabolic, growth, and reproductive rates of most pathogenic microorganisms
- Desiccation (drying) :: Inhibits microbial growth due to removal of water
  - Viruses and endospores can resist desiccation
- Filtration :: Passage of air or a liquid through a material that traps and removes microorganisms
  - HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters remove microbes and particles from air
- High Osmotic Pressure :: Exerted by hypertonic solutions of salt or sugar to preserve food by removing the water microbes need to carry out metabolic functions
  - Fungi are more capable than bacteria of growing in materials with low moisture or high osmotic pressure
- Irradiation :: Sample is exposed to radiation, which includes high-speed subatomic particles and even more energetic electromagnetic waves released from atoms
  - Ionising radiation (wavelengths shorter than 1 nm, e.g. X-rays) :: Produces ions that denature important biomolecules and kill cells
  - Non-ionising radiation (wavelengths longer than 1 nm, e.g. UV light) :: Less effective, but can cause lethal mutations by introducing pyridmidine dimers in DNA

*** Chemical Methods for Reducing Microorganisms
- Used outside of body
- Used on living tissues (as antiseptics) and on inanimate objects (as disinfectants or sterilants)
- Antiseptics :: Used for handwashing and surface wounds
- Some chemicals act as antiseptics at one concentration/ exposure time, but disinfectants at another

** Controlling Microbial Growth Inside the Body
*** Chemical Therapy
- Broad vs Narrow spectrum
- Synthetic antimicrobial drugs :: substances that interfere with the growth of microbes within a host
- Growth factor analogs :: act as competitive inhibitors of key metabolic reactions
- Antibiotic :: Substance (secondary metabolite) produced by a microbe
  - Bactericidal :: Kills other microbes directly
  - Bacteriostatic :: Inhibits growth
- Beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins) :: Fungal in origin, possess a beta-lactam ring that inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis by interfering with tetrapeptide cross-linking (transpeptidation)

*** Protein Synthesis Inhibitors
- Bacterial in origin
- Aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides target taht 30S or 50S ribosomal subunit
- Macrolides commonly prescribed to those allergic to penicillin, useful in treating legionnaires disease

*** Transcription Inhibitors
- Blocks RNA polymerase from synthesising RNA

*** Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Inhibitor (Platensimycin)
- Useful for previously untreatable infections, including MRSA/VRSA

*** Teixobactin
- Isolated in 2015 from a previously uncultured soil-growing microbe
- Prevents syntehsis of cell wall precursors
- First new class of antibiotic in decades

*** Natural Antibiotic Modification
- Leads to broadening of their spectrum of activity
- Natural penicillin can't cross the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, but ampicillin can
- Some organisms can degrade penicillin with an enzyme, but methicillin is resistant to degradation

*** Synergy
- Combinations of antibiotics may prove more effective than either alone
- Penicillins increase cell wall permeability, which increase the uptake and effectiveness of aminoglycosides

*** Antibiotic Antagonism
- Simultaneous administration of bactericidal and bacteriostatic drugs leads to antibiotic antagonism

**** Effectiveness of Antibiotics
- Broth dilution tests determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)
- Disk diffusion antibiotic sensitivity method reveals which drug is most effective against a particular pathogen the larger the zone of inhibition around a drug-soaked disk on a Petri plate, the more effective the tested drug

**** Antifungal
- Antifungal arsenal is greatly reduced and with greater side effects
- Largely restricted to drugs taht prevent key cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane component synthesis

**** Anti-parasitic Drugs
- Often toxic to both parasite and host
- Differential toxicity, as opposed to selective toxicity

***** Factors
- Uptake or exposure
- Metabolic processing of the drug
- Susceptibility of drug action, even though the re are functionally equivalent targets in the host vs parasite

**** Anti-virals
- Many unique aspects of the viral life cycle present numerous drug targets

***** Aspects
- Host adsorption
- Host entry and uncoating
- Nucleic acid
- Protein synthesis
- Assembly of new viruses
- Viral release from host cell
