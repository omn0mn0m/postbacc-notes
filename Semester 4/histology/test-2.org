* Module 4 - Muscle and Nerve


* Module 5 - Circulatory System and Immune System

** Functions
- Transports O2 to tissues
- Transports CO2 away from tissues

** Components
- Blood and circulatory system

** Pathway
- Right Atrium -> Right Ventricle -> Pulmonary Artery -> Pulmonary Arterioles -> Lungs
- Lungs -> Pulmonary Venules -> Pulmonary Vein -> Left Atrium
- Left Atrium -> Left Ventricle -> Aorta -> Systemic Artery -> Systemic Arterioles -> Systemic Capillaries
- Systemic Capillaries -> Systemic Venules -> Systemic Veins -> Vena Cava -> Right Artrium

** Heart
- Pumps blood continuously throughout life
  - Intrinsic pacemakers
- Entire muscle must contract with each beat
  - Specialised conduction system
  - Intercalated disc
    - Gap junctions: cell-cell conduction
    - Adherens junctions, desmosomes
- Blood flow must be unidirectional
  - Specialised valves
- Must receive O2 and nutrients
  - Heart is supplied by coronary arteries

** Arteries and Veins
- Arteries are thicker than veins
- Arteries tend to stay round
- Veins can collapse more easily

*** Superficial to Deep Layers
- Endothelium
- Intima
- Media
- Adventitia
- Vasa vasorum

*** Artery Functions
- Conductance: Elastic
- Distribution: Muscular
- Regulation: Arterioles

** Immune System
*** Lymphoid Tissue
- Usually found in mucosa
- Usually non-encapsulated

**** Types
- GALT
- BALT
- MALT
- Tonsils

*** Thymus
**** Function
- Production of immumocompetent T lymphocytes

**** Embryology
- Endodermal cells give rise to epithelial reticular cells

**** Organisation
- Cortex and medulla
- Connective tissue capsule
- Lobular

***** Thymus Cortex
- Site of T cell maturation
- Densely staining due to large number of lymphocytes
- Contain epithelial reticular cells but they are more difficult to ID

***** Blood-Thymic Barrier (Cortex)
- Maintains a supply of naiive stem cells
- Prevents blood-bourne antigens from reaching developing T-cells

****** Components
- Capillary endothelium
- Endothelial basal lamina
- Macrophages
- Reticular cell basal lamina
- Reticular cells

***** Thymus Medulla
****** Site of Hassall's Corpuscle
- Presence of epithelial reticular cells
  - Less lymphocytes so lighter staining

******* Hassall's Corpuscles
- Consists of concentric layers of flattened epithelial reticular cells
- Produces a cytokine
- Plays a role in dendritic cell induction of certain T cells

*** Lymph Node Medulla
**** Medullary Cords
- Contains plasma cells, B lymphocytes, reticular cells, and macrophages

**** Medullary Sinuses
- Irregular spaces containing lymph, macrophages, plasma cells


* Module 5 ID
** c32_40xr
- Cardiac muscles: striated, intercalated discs
- Pukinjie fibres: large cells, lines cardiac muscle

** artery_vein_01_74_40xr
- Arteries: internal, wavy, elastic lamina (scalloped interior)
  - Tunica Intima: Internal region of artery
  - Tunica Media: Largest section of artery
  - Tunica Adventitia: Outside region of artery, half the size of tunica media
- Veins: no wavy lamina

** c18_40xr
- Artery: scalloped interior
  - External elastic lamina: between tunica adventitia and tunica media
- Vein: Not as squished, main distinguisher is lack of scalloped interior
- Peripheral nerve bundle
  - Axons: White circles (myelinated sheath) with dots (axon)

** l35_40xr
- Lymph node
- Lymph node medulla: interior region
  - Medullary cords: darker regions
  - Medullary sinuses: lighter regions
- Lymph node cortex: exterior region
  - Germinal center: lighter region
  - Paracortex: Inner region
  - Outer cortex: Outer region
- Capsule of connective tissue: pink area around the lymph node

** Web Slides
*** 77029
 - Cardiac muscle

*** 41
 - Cardiac muscle
 - Stained with colloroid
   - Blue = collagen

*** 45
 - Artery at bottom: thicker wall
   - Predominant cell in media: Elastic fibre
 - Vein at top: collapsed
   - adventitia is thickest layer in vein
 - Area next to vein:
   - Artery on the left (thicker)
   - Vein on the right (thinner and collapsed)
 - Capillaries: about the size of a blood cell

*** 18
 - Thymus
 - Has lobes
 - Single coloured red areas are vessels
 - Reticular cells -> desmosomes: Most easily found in medulla
   - Large nucleus

*** 19
- Spleen
  - Red pulp: darker area
  - White pulp: lighter area


* Module 6 ID
** Skin
- s79_40xr: thick skin
- s76_40xr: thin skin

** Respiratory
- Lung for exam will be web slides
