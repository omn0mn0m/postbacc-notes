* Figure 1

  - male male aggression
  - Gal4-UAS -> important system for group figure
  - activates TF like in yeast
  - UAS is target for transcription factor
  - Genes are neuropeptides
  - TK 1 & 2 increase aggression, 3 & 4 does not
  - TrpA1 = leaky sodium channel protein
  - 22 C is restrictive temperature

* Figure 2
  - Shows are specific to male brain
  - J shows aggression suppression due to use of K+ channel

* Figure 3
  - Negative data

* Figure 4
  - Dashed line == missing DNA
  - Yellow + grey == exon
  - Line connecting boxes == intro

* Figure 5
  - Same deletion but with tachykinen

* Figure 6
  - Explain that figure uses data from Figures 1 and 5
  - Explain results
  - At 22 C, no aggression
  - Fig A shows 1 Tk gene
    - 3rd column shows that deletion does not fully remove aggression
  - Fig B shows hyper aggression
    - If all 3 are present, then same result as Figure 1
  - Focus for discussion:
    - Fig C shows Takr86C is the receptor
    - Grey is uncoded, orange is coded, thin line is intron
    - Green dotted line is what was deleted (mutant of Takr86C for deletion)
    - Tk necessary for hyperaggression, not necessarily aggression
  - Division of figures: {A, B}, {C, [D,E]}
